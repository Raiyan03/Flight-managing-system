# Flight System

## About

This is a Flight Management System developed using the .NET MAUI BLAZOR hybrid framework, leveraging the power of C#. The application seamlessly reads and processes Flights and Airports data stored in Excel sheets. Users can easily make bookings by selecting flights that operate between specific departure and destination airports on a chosen day.

As users make bookings, the system efficiently saves their reservation details in a JSON file, representing each booking as a JSON object. To enhance user experience and facilitate easy retrieval, the system automatically generates a unique ID for each booking. This unique identifier simplifies the process of viewing and editing booking details, ensuring a smooth and organized user interaction with the Flight Management System.
